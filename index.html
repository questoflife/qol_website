                things I have had the pleasure of joining. <em class="highlight-text">The groups are put together with a lot of
                care.</em> In sessions, we are guided through ways to communicate and listen to others struggles
                while respecting their boundaries. As someone who tends to be very shy about trusting others I have felt
                incredibly safe, comfortable, and open to sharing my feelings with the people in my group. Over the past
                weeks <em class="highlight-text">I have seen a lot of productive changes in the way I approach my
                problems and the way I communicate with others in my life</em>. I think the sessions really give an opportunity to empathize and
                understand with one another. Not only letting me share my struggles and having others help me figure out more about them,
                but even learning something myself through helping them work through their issues."

                example, today I recognized some inner loops I tend to repeat in my life, just by sharing my story and
                getting
                good questions from my group. It's also interesting to learn from others, because everyone basically
                lives
                in
                their own world, so seeing new perspectives is always refreshing. On top of that, we started to meditate

                me
                open up to an extent I couldn't have imagined. Everyone was so empathic and a patient listener. Before
                joining the group I was in a mental void of victimizing myself and thinking that I was the only one who
                has
                so many challenges in life. Being able to make friends in the group opened up my mind to what I was
                missing
                all this time. I'm glad to be a part of such a wonderful group of people including really helpful
                facilitators."
