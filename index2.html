                                                "Before joining this group, I felt very alone; I had to take a break from therapy due to financial reasons. As someone easily swayed by emotions, I felt like all the progress I had made to improve my life had disappeared because I was alone with my negative thoughts.

                                                Since joining group coaching, I've regained a sense of hope. Being able to learn about others' struggles and share my worries without judgment every week has been extremely enlightening. On days when I would usually lie in bed feeling dejected due to a setback in life, I find myself thinking about what we discussed in the group sessions, which helps me push forward.
                                                
                                                I'm grateful to Tom and the other facilitators for building this community, and I hope more support can be given to help it flourish."

                                                "I initially joined because I finally finished my thesis and graduated IT. I had done some internships before graduating but I felt demotivated to look for a job right away. I was confused whether I had some trauma in IT industry or IT is simply not my passion. Not to mention I was also raised in Singapore and I struggle with adapting to life in Indonesia. I also had moved for more than 10 times in my life. I hoped by joining a group coaching I would have been more convinced what was really my obstacle.

                                                The concept of coaching was very new to me. I had gone to about 7 different types of psychologists and psychotherapists. Alongside with tens of workshops and support group about mental health. Going to therapy first time was such a struggle. I was on and off for way too long. I kept circling between denial, ruminating, then I move, isolation, then find new therapist again and so on. Now that I've gone to group coaching, I totally recommend everyone who's considering to go to therapy also try go to group coaching simultaneously so that they don't feel so alone about how they suck at life or taking it too personally. If I was to go to therapy with group coaching now, It probably would be less awkward and more comfortable to be vulnerable with the therapist.
                                                
                                                My biggest takeaway is therapy is like parenting for only-child-adults digging the past, while group coaching is like slowly putting it into practice from the present. It was an eye-opening experience. It gave me hope that there's always going to be a community welcoming you to actively listen to you without offering any unsolicited advices whenever you're up for it. And for free? I'd always sign up in a heartbeat.
                                                I personally took my time to open up to be careful how this group coaching works. I also realize being an eldest daughter gives me tendency to give others space first. As I listened to other people's deep dive into their problems, I realized there were some topics that I still get triggered by. That's my pointers where I still need to heal. I also really enjoyed trying to read the room, to break the ice when it's tense, to show compassion when someone opens up. My anxiety and depression is still there, but I feel like I can coexist with them better these days. 
                                                
                                                The facilitators are organized, responsive, punctual and compassionate. Everything is well thought and anticipated. The feedbacks forms, the lettucemeet form, the discord threads, the no talking outside group, and sometimes zoom too when the discord connection isn't very good. My facilitators (Tom and Thomas) were also willing to extend the session from 16 to 20 weeks. They're doing it all without charge. It's really different when people are there for the money or for the faith in humanity. I truly feel so grateful to be a part of this. I appreciate it guys. Thank you so much."

                                                "Before joining the group i had no idea how group coaching works and i was scared and very skeptical whether it would help or not but im glad i had the courage and took the decision to joined the group as it turned out to be really helpful.
                                                I was struggling with social anxiety and depression related to my inability to communicate properly about by mental health issues. Being part of a group which has people from different cultural backgrounds and different countries made me open up to an extent o couldn't have imagined. Everyone was so empathic and a patient listener.
                                                Before joining the group i was in a mental void of victimizing myself and thinking that i was the only one who has so many challenges in life. Being able to make friends in the group opened up my mind to what i was missing all this time.
                                                My social anxiety has improved a lot, my communication skills and fear of people has reduced and most importantly i am less scared to share my mental struggles to people in my life.
                                                I'm glad i was given opportunity to be a part of such a wonderful group of people including really helpful facilitators.
                                                I have 2 years of experience with therapy before the group coaching. Although therapy is very useful for 1v1 interaction and more deeper level of communication, i found that group coaching is another form of therapy which although has limitations for obvious reasons but in the long run gives us a lot of insight about how others approach their life struggles.
                                                First and most important thing the group coaching offers is coaching free to f cost. A lot of people struggle financially which is one of the most common reasons for people to approach for group coaching or therapy.
                                                Also being able to communicate to people from different countries and different cultural backgrounds is really useful for personal growth mentally and emotionally.
                                                I don't think group coaching needs any improvement, its already close to perfection. But with time im pretty sure its only going to get better given the opportunity."

                                                "I didn't really know what to expect so didn't really expect much. I hoped I would get at least some more social skills but I have gotten much more.

                                                One session I talked about how hard it is for me to go to sleep at a reasonable hour and how my mind resists it and after a few days I noticed I didn't have problems to take melatonin at 8pm even when I have struggled years to take it around 10pm.

                                                Maybe a year or two ago I finally noticed how harsh I am to myself but couldn't really stop it but now after being in a couple of groups I have actually gotten quite a bit more understanding towards myself. 
                                                Now when I notice I start to blame myself for something I have tools to question it and think if it really is accurate or just my brains habit.

                                                I also tend to leave getting ready and packing to the last minute (and am late) but after gaining some understanding of the reason it's been easier to sometimes gather things the day before or at least feel much less anxious about it and somehow that has made me get out of the door a bit faster.

                                                Having the weekly meetings mean at least once a week I actually stop and think about stuff and it really helps to identify emotions with or without the emotion wheel and to get questions from others or think what I could ask from someone else regarding the topic of the session."

However as a broke college student finding the money to allocate towards such, even if I would love to pay for it, was and has been incredibly difficult. I had joined this group deciding to give it a chance as I thought even some help would be more useful than none. I was pleasantly surprised that this counseling group ended up being one of the most organized and productive things I have had the pleasure of joining. The groups are put together with a lot of care, and the issues I had come to work through were quite close to my peers giving us a lot to discuss about. In sessions we are guided through ways to communicate and listen to others struggles while respecting their boundaries. As someone who tends to be very shy about trusting others I have felt incredibly safe, comfortable, and open to sharing my feelings with the people in my group. Over the past weeks I have seen a lot of productive changes in the way I approach my problems and the way I communicate with others in my life. I think the sessions really give an opportunity to empathize and understand with one another. Not only letting me share my struggles and having others help me figure out more about them, but even learning something myself through helping them work through their issues. I think this coaching group is phenomenally put together and has made a good impact on my life and the way I deal with my current struggles. This group really has solidified my feelings of wanting to continue counseling in the future. For now while I work hard to eventually be able to pay for coaching, this has been a great step towards seeking help for myself."

                                                "What were your initial expectations before joining a group?
                                                I've had some personal one-on-one coaching experience before, so I thought it'd be similar but will also include group members' input and I could also learn from looking at other group members' cases.

                                                How did group impact your life? (please be specific if you can)
                                                The group created something that I could look forward to every week, not only as a productive activity that helps with my mental but also as a fun social event. Also it added accountability element, if I have decided to do something and shared it with the group, I would be much more likely to finish what I set out to do. On top of that, we started to meditate after every group session, which is very impactful if you know how beneficial meditation is

                                                What's something you learned in group? About yourself? About other people? (please be specific if you can)
                                                I learn something every session, for example, today I recognized some inner loops I tend to repeat in my life, just by sharing my story and getting good questions from my group. It's also interesting to learn from others, because everyone basically lives in their own world so seeing new perspectives is always refreshing.

                                                Have you tried other forms of support before? How does this group coaching compare?
                                                I've tried personal coaching before, it was obviously more effective as all attention is on you for the whole session but I think for people who prefer group settings group coaching can work even better than the individual approach, it adds a social layer to coaching, and many fellow gamers usually want it in their lives.

                                                What unique benefits do you think our group coaching offers that you haven't found elsewhere?
                                                I think it's the HG background everyone here shares so even though everyone is unique we always have some common grounds to connect with each other.

                                                Is there anything you think we could improve about our group coaching sessions?
                                                I only have limited experience, in 2 groups I participated in, the facilitation was done well, the organization too, usually what I don't like on sessions is either myself or some group member, but it's all personal issues which cannot be fixed on organizational level."

                                                "Before joining the group, I was hoping to surround myself with people who understand mental health, its challenges, and offer compassion and kindness. The group exceeded my expectations in many ways.

                                                The session particularly helped me dealing with my social anxiety, the group helped me feel more comfortable being heard and seen. I also learned valuable communication skills like reflective listening, practicing open-ended questions. 

                                                The group created a supportive environment where vulnerability was not only accepted but encouraged allowing me to feel comfortable sharing my thoughts without fear of judgement. The appreciation circle at the end of each session was particularly meaningful, providing valuable insight that helped me combat negative self-perceptions.

                                                What sets this group coaching apart is its unique blend of compassionate and kind individuals from around the world. I felt supported and learned how to help others help themselves. I realized it's okay to be heard and seen, and that sharing difficulties with others makes me feel less alone in my struggles. 

                                                Overall, the group helped me become more resilient and comfortable with myself, and I'm grateful for the experience."

                                                "Group coaching has been recommended multiple times in the channel but it's not accessible to everyone in the world. Thanks to Tom, I had the opportunity to try it. I didn't have much expectation before started but after 10 session, I already felt the positive impact to my life. 

                                                I am able to think in a more structured way because it provides a no-judgement space for me to voice out my mind. There's a specific instance where the group helped process my feeling of ""not wanting to bother people"". The coaching also improved my communication by providing opportunity to safely practice communication skills like reflective listening & asking open-ended question. In the end, I feel more empathetic to people and people's response to me has relatelively improved.

                                                I would recommend this program to anyone that require some sort of support! Of course if it's affecting your daily life, please seek professional helps 🙂"

                                                "What were your initial expectations before joining a group?
                                                I didn't really have expectations, of course it would have been nice to completely solve my problems, but I hoped to at least lessen my problems or gain a lead on where to go.

                                                How did group impact your life? (please be specific if you can)
                                                Learning about other peoples problems, even those that were not related to me, gave me a sense of, ""I am not alone"", and sometimes gave me ideas on what to do with myself. 

                                                Have you tried other forms of support before? How does this group coaching compare?
                                                I did some counseling before and to be honest it was better since they are trained professionals and it was 1 on 1, it gave me better feedback and knew me more than my groupmates. However, as I mentioned before being with people in similar situations gave it more relatability and also with their feedbacks or compliments, it doesn't feel as ingenuine which counselors may feel like it is compelled.

                                                What unique benefits do you think our group coaching offers that you haven't found elsewhere?
                                                You're able to connect to people all over world and that the service is free.

                                                Is there anything you think we could improve about our group coaching sessions?
                                                More times and schedules but I do expect that for a free service."

                                                A lesson I learned in the group is to be more proactive rather than laid-back and passive. My peers in the group taught me this when they shared their feedback with me. 
                                                Participating in the group also helped me get more comfortable talking to people on camera. I used to have anxiety around that, and probably still do, but the weekly meetings made me a little more comfortable than when I first started."
